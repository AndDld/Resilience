# Very brief introduction

There are several definitions of resilience but...

**the ability to be minimally affected by disturbances and/or to rapidly return to a stable state after a disturbance**  (Colditz and Hine, 2016)

After the observations that diseases and environmental changes can influence the productivity of animals, assuming fixed the conditions of farming, **longitudinal data** have been starting to face an intensive use.

# Fedeli's farm

In the same way, we are going to analyze the data of a farm in Lombardy (Lombardia), Italy, to understand the resilience of those cows.

# How to infer general resilience?

**Assuming** that the daily milk production per se is a good proxy of the general resilience.

Wt still miss something... a reference system.  
A curve that is assumed to be unperturbed.
